This project aims to develop neural networks that classify sceientific paper abstracts into respective fields.

- bow_classification.ipynb file contains simple feedforward neural networks using BOW & pre trained embeddings.
- rnn.ipynb file contains simpleRNN , LSTM, GRU, BI RNN models.

- the data set being used can be downloaded from https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/arxiv-10
- pre trained embeddings can be downloaded from (you'll need 300d for these files) https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
- install respective python libraries if you get error.
- update file paths if needed.
